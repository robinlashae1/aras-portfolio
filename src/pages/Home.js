					<h1> Hi there!</h1>
				<p> My name is Ara Fritz. I’m a nonbinary multi-cultural UX/UI designer from Philadelphia. I thrive in creative enenvironments 
					and have a passion for creating art in many forms. I became a designer to achieve my two life goals: to bring more beauty 
					into the world and to foster opportunities for human connection. When I’m not designing, you can catch me in a 
					recorecording studio with my friends singing and writing music for my new album :)
