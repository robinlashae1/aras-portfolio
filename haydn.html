                The primary concern surrounding Haydn is that it’s a new product . I kept this thought in my mind as I began to do research for the marketing landing page. It was important for me to understand the client’s vision for their product, in order to keep with the desired tone and branding elements right from the start.

                  Each competitor has minimal, easy to understand top navigations featuring around 4-5 items.
                  Each competitor has prominently displayed call-to-action buttons that are immediately visible when entering their website.
                  All of the competitors have modern, sleek, minimalistic designs that align with current UI trends.

                Once the sitemap was finalized, I began brainstorming ideas for Haydn's marketing page. While keeping in mind the minimalistic design approaches adopted by Haydn's competitors, I also aimed to maintain the brand's established tone, as outlined by the client. Haydn's brand identity exudes a warm, beachy, and somewhat formal atmosphere. The client expressed their preference for avoiding a business-like or artificial feel in the branding. Instead, they emphasized the importance of creating a website that feels as human-centered as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left"> I hopped onto Pinterest and began ideating around color choices and imagery. </p>

                The objective was to convey a welcoming and playful atmosphere through the colors and imagery, all while maintaining a simple and minimalistic layout. Utilizing this moodboard and incorporating the preexisting assets provided by the client, I  completed the marketing landing page.

            <p class="text-left">   Research is the foundation of all design decisions. It is essential to approach research with objectivity, free from preconceived notions and biases. When designing, don't forget to look back and ask yourself if the choices your making align with the research, or if any additional research is necessary to support the design choices made.</p>
